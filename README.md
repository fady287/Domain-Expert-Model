My task in this project was to train (fine-tune) a large language model. This model should become a domain expert, capable of generating informative, accurate, and contextually relevant text responses. Think of it as creating a knowledgeable consultant for the company!

The Challenge:

Selecting the Dataset: Choose an appropriate, copyright-free unstructured text dataset relevant to a domain. You'll choose from finance, medical, or IT datasets. This dataset will be the training ground for your model to learn domain-specific language and concepts.
